                <p class="extra-space">Lynna's practice involves observations that extend beyond the subject itself, searching to establish connections and order in space. Her work often originates from written texts and listening experiences. By collecting fragments, the medium adapts to the conceptual framework, spanning from drawings, installations, and digital-based works. Within the intertwining branches, she observes their nature parallelly, she tries to find out why she is interested inâ€”consciousness and dreams, technology and nature, collectives and individuals. The complexities of entanglement are often curious to deconstruct, where she often seeks to reinterpute and transcend the boundaries between the contraries. Geometry, anthropology, semantics and sounds are her fields of interest.</p>

                <p class="extra-space">Born 1999, currently based in Hong Kong. She is one of the studio resident at Interval:in for 2023-2025. She also is a co-founder of B-Complex @<a href="https://www.instagram.com/bcomplex.collective/" target="_blank">bcomplex.collective</a>, an art collective established in 2023.
